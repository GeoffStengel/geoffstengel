<p>		
	Before I forget, this is kinda of a broad or general disclaimer "disclamerish".. We do not store any data
	the only cookies being used are from google analytics, & i dont know any other options to gather stats &
	analytics lol.
<p>Throughout the website some of the links have an affiliate link with "if lucky am making
	a few dollars here and there from them", only have them on products that I use or used myself, or think
	for real that they're a good product, or at least up to standards based on todays technology and ability..
	also the affiliate link is in there as well because we were probably already talking about the product
	and was already recommending or suggesting, so mind as well make a few bucks if possible.. that's how the
	site can keep going, 
<p>just like to lay my cards on the table. yup there was my disclamerish, oh also
	I'm not a professional, stuff here is opinions, and you should always do your own research (DYR), 
	the other most common saying only bet what you can afford to lose.. This disclaimer also goes for my chat
	groups, any chat groups, group texts, group conversations, one on one calls, one on one texts,
	one on one conversations, social media posts, social media groups, all and any future social media sites,
	groups, or discords.
<p>
   For projects that am working	on, with, sharing opinons to etc.., i'm not directly affiliated with any of them,
    i Geoff Stengel am 100% an Independent Contractor who can only vouge for my self lol, 
	which also my views an opinons are soley my own

<p>
	
<p>	
<p>	
	 hopefully that covers that on the legal jargen ü§ì
</p>
			
<p>
	also from time to time, i come back and update some of the content, always finding
	little mistakes or typos, trying to keep everything as accurate as possible. 
	Thank you hope the site is helpful enjoy!
