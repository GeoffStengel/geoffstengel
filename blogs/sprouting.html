   🌱If you dig <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprouting" _target="">sprouting</a> beans, than this is the place for you.
    Can you remember the first time you seen someone sprouting their own beans
    or grains?!  Welp I sure can!  It just fascinated me so much that you could fill up an entire jar after a few days with fresh veggies,
    any time ya wanted! Just soak em basically than strain every 8 hours.
</p>

<p>   
    But lets go over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process">process</a> together, so you can have an easy step by step guide,
    as well as situations to looks out for.

    First i should say, i'm not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dietitian">Dietitian</a> or
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutritionist">Nutritionist</a>, just a hippie that likes good food 😄  
    Have done this process for many years,
    so hoping that some of these experiences help you along your sprouting journey.  
</p>
<p>
    Most Impotant!! If you're allergic to any of the beans mentioned, please find one that works for ya.  
    Also if ya dont keep them in a somewhat clean or sanitary envionment, sprouts can give ya the runs & can be susceptible to
    <a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>. That's why it's good to grow them yourself so we know how they were handled & grown.
    Umm Kaayyy, now that we're past that part of the discussion lol. lets move on
</p> 
<hr class="youtube_divider">
<br> 
<p>  
    Are there any beans or grains you've always wanted to sprout?
    i find that Mung or Lentils is the easiest to start off with, or most easily accesible. Sooo, lets hope a few picked those beans as
    ones ya wanted to start off with lol.  Feel Free to comment on my <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@stengelgeoff">Tiktok</a> or 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@eugeneglassmenagerie">Youtubes</a> sprouting vids, with any suggestions
    of ones ya want to see next, or just even want to learn about!
</p>
<p>
    Good rule of thumb start with something smaller than a Black-Eyed Pea, the larger the bean you should cook em a bit,
    rather than eating them raw.
</p>
<img src="/img_blogs/sprouting_blk_lentils_02_img.png">


<p>I do love my black-eyed peas tho and sprouting em.  Them i do cook when doing a stir fry or such.
    That's where the line for me eating raw vs cooking is.
</p>

<p>
    To start off your sprouts you will be taking 1/4 cup of Beans, & first i like to begin with
    cleaning & sorting the beans, before putting in the Jar.  You will pick through the 1/4 cup to make sure
    there are no stones, pebbles or any other debrit that ya might munch on.
</p>
<p>
    After the beans are cleaned up a bit from debrit, pour them into the jar & fill the rest up with clean water. 
    Putting your <a href="https://amzn.to/3UMhVxm">Stainless Mesh Lid</a> on top.
</p>
<p>
    As they start soaking the water probably will turn a milky color or look discolored & dirty.  Especially if
    you're sprouting Red Lentils.  I rinse those off multiple times right when i put em in the jar.  The Red Lentils
    totally turn the water to a thick milky color & every time i see it i say "That's why we soak & rinse instead of
    just pouring the beans into a pot & eating em!!".
</p>

<p>
    Let those soak for 8 hours, i like to have the jars tilted at an angle to allow the remaining water or moisture to
    drip out properly & have good air flow. 
</p>
<p>    
    Pro Tip, when i walk by the jars sometimes during the day i actually give
    the jar a little turn rotating it & you will see some water drip out that was caught in the lid.
    You don't want them sitting in stagnant water getting possibly mushy. 
    It's good to let them dry out evenly, in some of my videos you will see i use a 
    <a href="https://amzn.to/3DQqSfb">OXO 4-Cup Angled Measuring Cup</a> that has a ledge inside, 
    those work well if you don't have the <a href="https://amzn.to/3OORtz4">Custom Frames</a> for Jars.
</p>

<p>
    This process of Rinsing & Straining every 8 hrs you will repeat for a few days, so 3x's a day you rinse & let strain out.
    Bamm you will start to see Sprouts growing, from day 1 you should see the bean start to grow a tiny tail.  That's when you
    really want to be a tad concious of being to ruff with the beans when rinsing em out with fresh water. Sometimes i see
    people having the water pressure on full blast knocking off the fresh growth.  The root needs a little time to still strength in my opinion.
    maybe be gentle 🌱
</p>
<p>
    In a few days time they should be ready depending on the bean & depending on what your pallet finds most attractive & appetizing.
    The Red Lentils i start tasting after around 48-72hrs & as the root grows the flavor changes a bit. For the Mung Bean around 48hrs (4 days)
    
</p>
<p>
    Times may vary depending on the temperture conditions in your sprouting enviornment.  If it's colder they will take a bit longer.

<p>Lately been doin more Youtube videos to branch out, honestly cause i'm not the greatest at spelling
    & thought videos would be fun way to network with people.  At first i didn't think was good at it when
    tried over the yrs. But as watching the videos & learning editing i seen so much improvement
    it's been a lot of fun. Also to, sometimes it even maybe uncomfortable, but i say rather
    do this & feel uncomfortable than deliver $1 coffees lol.  You can view my earliest ones yrs ago in the playlist
