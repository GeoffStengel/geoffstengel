	hello World Welcome Back to the new website.  It was down for a bit & wanted to write a blog to update on projects!!

</p>

<p>
    Basically been in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago" target="_blank">Chicago</a> the last few yrs doing bike stuff, blowing Glass, working deliveries, learning to code,
     web design, 3D, & Crypto etc.. kinda was trying to build some skills so when on the road,
    or livin the nomad lifestyle, have some income coming in.  At times it's touchy to setup the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassblowing" target="_blank">glassblowing</a> bench
    in certain areas, as we've seen in previous yrs or episodes. so my thought was gain some skills in other areas
    that would still benefit the art & music thing that had going on over the yrs & still involving bikes, Trucks & adventures.
    Giving the freedom that we desire. Sometimes we gotta adapt & evolve if that makes sense.  Example, 
    just made this website coding with the skills learned (it's not greatest but i made it tho lol)
</p>

<p>
    So this site will be a good a hub for my Art, Music, Harmonicas, Bikes, Adventures, Tech & who knows!!
    but as creators, crafters & Artists we need our own platforms.  It's kinda like having your own store
    but you dont have to have a physical location.  Perfect!!  Also we are now reaching even more people 
    with the internet growing each day. (which could be a good thing or not so good thing) So who knows
    what things will grow into sometimes ideas go viral.
</p>
<p>
    The Harmonica shop section on the site along with a few other musical accessories was something that
    i've wanted to keep going.  Years ago people saw/heard me trying to be a travelling Harmonica Salesman lol.
    But having someone else do the shipping, inventory & all that now makes this a lot more feasible cause
    am usually living outta the truck or hammock.
 </p>
 <p>  
    To be transparent, when i was selling Harmonicas
    outta Eugene Glass Menagerie i still made the same profit a buck or 2 per Harp, it's not that much it's more love of passion
    than a desire to profit. So this opportunity really helps me be able to focus on the Harp info, selection
    things like that.  Even tho it's a buck or two profit i appreciate ya picking up your Harps here, it helps
    keep everything going in the glass harmonica world & future projects. Which the Glass Diatonics is very much
    an expensive project (which is funded fully by geoff stengel no investors) I appreciate ya.
    So we got the Harp shop long story short🤓 
</p>
<p>
    Anyways Thank you for all the support, will probably add some more to this but wanted
     to at least say something to Y'all while building the site

<p>Lately been doin more Youtube videos to branch out, honestly cause i'm not the greatest at spelling
    & thought videos would be fun way to network with people.  At first i didn't think was good at it when
    tried over the yrs. But as watching the videos & learning editing i seen so much improvement
    it's been a lot of fun. Also to, sometimes it even maybe uncomfortable, but i say rather
    do this & feel uncomfortable than deliver $1 coffees lol.  You can view my earliest ones yrs ago in the playlist

<a href=" " target="_blank"><p>Bitcoin Davida Crypto Info & Wallets:</p></a>

<p>One of the first sites i coded in 2016, possibly the Eugene Glass Menagerie site was before.
anywho, over the yrs managed to have kept up with the site from time to time to keep it going, another project that with
a bit of work here and there has grown into a nice place of knowledge.    
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://bitcoindavida.com/links_index.html" target="_blank"> Directory</a> (Links Page) has some of the best blockchain
companies all together as if it was The Crypto Yellow pages from back in the day.  It started from when i was getting into
<a href="https://bitcoindavida.com/blogs/bitcoin_atms.html" target="_blank">Bitcoin Atms</a> and needed a website along with basically saying the same info over & over that figured maybe all that info
could go together, the other inspirations was craigslist, at first the vision was the craigslist of crypto.  who knows
if that's still the idea lol, but i have palying the project and being involved in the crypto community.

<!---Github Logo Near Bottom------>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GeoffStengel" target="_blank"><img class="btc_logo" src="../images/github-mark.svg" alt="Bitcoin Logo"></a></p> 

<a href="https://github.com/GeoffStengel" target="_blank"><p>Github GeoffStengel Profile:</p></a>
<p><a href="https://github.com/GeoffStengel" target="_blank">Github</a> is a place for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developer" target="_blank">Developers</a> to share code & projects in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">Opensource</a> enviornment. This
    is an important section if your're intrested in getting a website from me in the future, github is where
    we will upload the code & have access to their servers from.  So i wanted to have my profile available
    in a few spots so there's easy access for ya.
